				This paper surveys exisitng literature for different approaches to solve the knapsack problem. The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in which one has to maximize the profits gained by packing a set of objects in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity. The problem is \textbf{\textit{NP}}-complete, thus there is no known polymial time algorithm for a large input. 

				Specifically, we take a look at the fractional and the 0/1 Knapsack Problem and provide a qualitative comparison between the three well-known approaches towards solving the problem: greedy, dynamic programming and branch \& bound algorithms.
