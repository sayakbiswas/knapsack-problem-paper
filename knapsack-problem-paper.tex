This paper surveys existing literature for different approaches to solve the knapsack problem. The Knapsack Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in which one has to maximize the profits gained by packing a set of objects in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity. The problem is \textbf{\textit{NP}}-complete, thus there is no known polynomial time algorithm for a large input.

Specifically, we take a look at the \textit{0-1 Knapsack Problem} and provide a qualitative comparison between the three well-known approaches towards solving the problem: brute-force, dynamic programming and branch \& bound algorithms.

\section{Introduction}
The \textit{0-1 Knapsack Problem} is an optimization problem, which at a high level is to choose the most profitable subset from a collection of available items without overloading the knapsack. The problem is formally defined as follows:

Given a knapsack of maximum capacity \textit{C} and \textit{n} items each weighing \textit{w\textsubscript{i}} and with an associated profit of \textit{p\textsubscript{i}}, the \textit{Knapsack Problem} is to choose a subset of the items such that the below holds true:

maximize $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\textit{p\textsubscript{i}x\textsubscript{i}}$

on the condition $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\textit{w\textsubscript{i}x\textsubscript{i}} \leq \textit{C}, \textit{x\textsubscript{i}} \in \{0, 1\}, \textit{i} = 1,...,\textit{n}$

The two most common variations are the \textit{Unbounded} and \textit{Bounded} Knapsack Problems.
